To ensure this file doesn't get massive and I don't put paid assets on a public Github repo I have not included some assets and are ignored in the gitignore.

To get this working download the following from the package manager:
-Fantasy Skybox FREE
-Dreamscape Nature : Meadows : Stylized Open World Environment
-Surfaces Lite
-TextMesh Pro

Other Assets used:
-Post Processing
-New Input System

Once they are in add them to "External Assets" folder and the game should run again :)
